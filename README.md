# Control Flow Check Positive Negative Even Odd Number
1- import the 'dart:io' library to be able to take input.
2- define an input variable to take an integer input.
3- check the sign of the number, if the number is greater than zero, we print indicating it's positive
4- or if the number is less than zero, we print indicating it's negative
5- otherwise, the number is neither positive nor negative because at this point it's a zero
6- next up, we check if the number modulo 2 equals 0, if that's true, then we print indicating that the number is even
7- otherwise, we print indicating the number is odd
